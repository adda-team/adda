Examples aimed at reproduction of published results (each folder corresponds to a specific paper), but they can also be browsed as illustrations of various applications and adapted to similar cases.

We plan to add more examples and invite ADDA users to contribute (based on their papers, where ADDA is used). The following describes the possible options of  for such contributions, but please consider them as guidelines rather than rigid framework. Importantly, any example will benefit the community. In general, examples may have various levels of completeness with respect to the goal of reproducing published figures: 
* **full**: contains ready-to-use scripts, which run ADDA, parse data from other methods (if needed), and plot the results (reproducing specific figures in the papers).
* **intermediate**: contains scripts, which were used to run ADDA and potentially parse or post-process the results. The published figures based on these simulations may be provided in vector format, such as SVG or PDF.
* **low**: contains lists of ADDA command lines, raw simulation results (if not too extensive), and published figures in vector format.

For many papers (especially older ones), the figures were produced with manual operation of proprietary software (e.g., Origin). This usually excludes the full option above, but you may still consider adding corresponding project file for reproducibility. Anyway, please include the figures themselves in some open vector format.
