The python code `bb_examples.py` performs the comparison of scattering intensities calculated with ADDA for two different Bessel beams. By default, they are LE and LM beams of order 2 scattered by a wavelength-sized sphere, but it can be easily modified inside the script.

Other folders (produced by the script):  
* `option_1/` - contains raw ADDA results (log file, mueller matrix, incident field, and cross sections by default) for the 1st command line option
* `option_2/` - the same for the 2nd option
* `saved/` - final figures in PDF format
