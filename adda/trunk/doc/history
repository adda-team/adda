----------------------------------
Ver. 0.73 - 02.03.06

! first stable release that has a manual and other documentation

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.74 - 29.03.06

+ Slightly increased the speed for scattered field calculation.
+ User manual improved.
* 'buggy' beam type removed (obsolete).
* '-nosym' and '-sym_enf' options combined to '-sym {no|enf}'.
- In documentation there was option  '-pol ldr avg' while actually it was
  '-pol ldr avgpol'. It is averaging over incident polarizations
  (not directions). Documentation corrected.
+ Internal fields are now automatically collected into one file, when running
  in parallel mode ('IntField-X' and 'IntField-Y')
- Saving of geometry in parallel mode could produce incomplete results (parts
  of some processors could be lost). Fixed.
+ MPI-specific command line options are enabled. Before they could cause
  segmentation fault.
* Geometry filename given to the command line option '-save_geom' is now
  specified relative to the output directory (i.e. if no path is given, it is
  saved into this directory).
+ Some warnings are now duplicated in the log.
+ In parallel mode each processor (except root) produces a separate logfile, if
  any errors or warnings were detected (on this specific processor). These files
  are named 'logerr.n' where n - is a number of processor.
* Minor changes to output format to stdout.
+ Added source files 'param.c/h'.
+ Overall robustness of the code is improved (added many consistency checks).
+ Help system added (new command line option -h).
- Fixed small bug in file locking (it could fail unexpectedly under certain
  circumstances).

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.74.2 - 05.04.06

+ Makefiles are more robust now. Option of using Intel compiler added.
+ Release option added to Makefiles (turns on/of all warnings automatically).
- A number of minor inaccuracies in the code fixed.
+ Section describing FFTW 3 installation added to the manual.

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.75 - 24.05.06

- Small bug in logging of command line fixed.
- Function 'system' (more precisely everything that calls 'fork') could fail
  unexpectedly under certain MPI implementations. All system calls removed.
+ Added source file 'os.h'.
+ Checking of errors in stdout has been added.
+ Possible size of FFT-grid (and non-weird number of processors) has been
  extended to full range of FFTW. One possible divisor of either 11 or 13
  has been added.
+ Increased robustness of makefiles with Intel compilers 8.1 and 9.0 in
  conjunction with MPICH.
* Sample file 'batch' renamed to 'test.pbs' in 'sample/'.
+ Added sample script for SGE 'sample/test.sge'.
+ Different descriptions of Gaussian beam are now fully operational. Help,
  references added. Evaluation of extinction crosssection is modified to be
  compliant with Gaussian beams.
- Origin is now always in the center of the computational box (before it was
  not so when jagged>1).
- When x_0=E_inc was used, more iterations than necessary to reach epsilon were
  performed. Fixed.
* Progress reported in the first iteration after checkpoint loading was
  incorrect in certain cases. To fix it required loss of checkpoint
  compatibility (!!!) with earlier versions.  Some additional information is
  shown after checkpoint loading.
- Sometimes in parallel mode program could die of some error before producing an
  error message. Fixed.
* Copyright statement changed in code description and output. Now it is with
  University of Amsterdam.
+ Precision increased to 10 in ouput of several variables into log.
- Calculation of Csca or g caused both polarizations to be calculated even for
  particles that are symmetric for 90 degree rotation over the z-axis. That is
  not necessary - fixed.
+ Integration module significantly improved. It automatically uses trapezoid
  rule for periodic function. Error estimates now seem to be reliable.
* Format of parameters for integration module changed because of improvement.
  It affects parameter files alldir_params.dat, avg_params.dat,
  scat_params.dat, making them incompatible with previous versions.
- Integration logs for Csca and g.x-g.z were saved in the same file for both
  incident polarizations. Now suffix "-X" or "-Y" is added to file names.
+ www page of ADDA is now available at
  http://www.science.uva.nl/research/scs/Software/adda/

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.76 - 14.10.06

+ Makefiles modified to include new compiler 'compaq'. New variables added to
  set path for FFTW3 header and library.
* Default dpl is now calculated based on the maximum absolute value among given
  refractive indices, not the first one. dpl=10*sqrt(max(|m|))
- Removed requirement of full set of refractive indices to be given for multi-
  domain scatterers, if '-prognose' option is used. Produces information
  message when relevant.
+ Added information about distribution of occupied dipoles among different
  domains to the log file for multi-domain particles.
* GPL license changed to version 2 - file 'copyleft' replaced.
+ New option '-V' added to show version, compiler used, and copyright
  information. A head with information and copyright is no more shown at every
  run (redundant).
+ All memory allocation routines are now called by similar-typed macros - much
  more cleaner. Robustness of memory handling improved.
+ Timing is now produced also when '-prognose' option is used. Communication
  times are shown only in parallel mode. Redundant calls to calculate
  communication timing in sequential mode removed.
* All timing in parallel mode is now done through MPI_Wtime, which measures
  wall time. No more timer overflows in parallel runs. New header 'timing.h' for
  this task.
+ Function attributes moved from 'const.h' to new header 'function.h'. Just for
  convenience.
- Communication timing now measures exactly communication times (synchronization
  before some communications is added for that).
- Memory requirement in the manual slightly corrected. The values produced by
  the program itself were correct.
+ New option '-granul <vol_frac> <diam> [<dom_number>]' to granulate one of the
  domains. When this option is used '_gran' is added to shapename. Currently it
  may easily fail for volume fraction larger than 30-40%. Separate timing is
  produced for granule generator.
  Two files added - 'mt19937ar.c/h' - for a random generator (Mersenne Twister).
  The header file slightly modified from the original.
- Bug in checkpointer fixed. Was not portable to systems where size_t!=int.
+ Added check if file system does not support file locking; error output of file
  locking and file removal is now more informative (errno string is shown).
- Orientation averaging did not work in parallel (reported by Antti Penttila).
  Fixed.
- Symmetries were not switched off by non-symmetric Gaussian beams. Fixed.
  Improved hadling of symmetries.
+ Computation of scattering of a tightly focused Gaussian beam was compared to
  multiple multipole method (data by Roman Schuh and Thomas Wriedt). Perfect
  aggreement. Results of the comparison are added to the manual.
+ Added chapter to the manual to facilitate adding a new predefined shape.
+ New file 'doc/faq' added for frequently asked questions.
+ New option '-store_beam' to save incident electric fields to a file.
+ Starting from this release ADDA executable for WIN32 is available. It is
  compiled with MinGW, and distributed with FFTW3 dll. Thanks to Alexander
  Shvalov for information on MinGW.
- ADDA crashed when one of the given refractive indices was equal to one. Check
  for this was added, now error message is produced in this case.
+ Added support for anisotropic refractive index (option '-anisotr'). Currently
  it is limited to refractive index tensors that are diagonal in the particle
  reference frame. Thanks to Michiel Min for fruitful discussions.

----------------------------------
Ver. 0.77 - ??.??.07

- Calculation of radiation forces gave segmentation fault. The bug was
  introduced in version 0.76. Fixed.
+ Improved handling of large integers throughout the program. 'size_t' type is
  used wherever possible, so it should work for any problem that would fit into
  memory. Checks of integer overflow where necessary to avoid craches.
+ Improved handling of input parameters to check for possible very large
  numbers, etc. Overall robustness improved.
+ Added checks to indicate incompatibility of orientation averaging and
  checkpoints with some other features.
